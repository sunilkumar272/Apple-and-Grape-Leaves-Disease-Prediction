# Apple-and-Grape-Leaves-Disease-Prediction

## Description
The proposed project utilizes transfer learning with deep learning techniques to predict the diseases in apple and grape leaves. ResNe18t and VGG16 CNN architectures are used to train the leaves images. The project requires PyTorch deep learning framework with GPU support using Python programming language. Used Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050, 4 GB graphics card for training the model.

## Dataset
The PlantVillage dataset is a well-known dataset available on Kaggle. It contains various collections of plant leaf images which include apple and grape leaf images as well. It contains 4 classes of apple leaves images, out of which one class is healthy, and, 4 classes of grape images, out of which one class is healthy. The apple image dataset consists of 3171 images and grape image dataset consists of 4062 images.

## Results
The ResNet18 and VGG16 models have achieved training and validation accuracies of over 90%. Due to their high accuracy on both the training and validation sets, both the ResNet and VGG models showed low bias. Both ResNet and VGG models have low variance because the differences between their training and validation accuracy are low.
